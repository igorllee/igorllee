Hi there! I'm a beginner developer with intermediate knowledge in JavaScript and PHP. I've had the opportunity to contribute to my previous companies by developing websites, even though programming wasn't my initial role. I faced various challenges during these projects, such as learning new technologies on the go and integrating complex features. However, I overcame these challenges with my determination and focus, ensuring the successful completion of the projects.


I'm currently studying React JS, Node JS, and TypeScript to enhance my web development skills.
